# Diabetic-Prediction
Diabetes is a common, chronic disease. Prediction of diabetes at an early stage can lead to improved treatment. Data mining techniques are widely used for prediction of disease at an early stage. In this research paper, diabetes is predicted using significant attributes, and the relationship of the differing attributes is also characterized. Various tools are used to determine significant attribute selection, and for clustering, prediction, and association rule mining for diabetes. Significant attributes selection was done via the principal component analysis method. Our findings indicate a strong association of diabetes with body mass index (BMI) and with glucose level, which was extracted via the Apriori method. Artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and K-means clustering techniques were implemented for the prediction of diabetes. The ANN technique provided a best accuracy of 75.7%, and may be useful to assist medical professionals with treatment decisions.
